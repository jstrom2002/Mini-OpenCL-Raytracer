TO DO
======
- resolve issues with sending uniforms to renderer for 'dragon.obj', etc. (esp lightType/skyboxIntensity/etc)
- figure out how to find 'CL_DEVICE_MAX_CONSTANT_ARGS' from 'clDeviceInfo' to determine the max number of kernel
arguments (see: CLutils.cpp)
- impl 'framestepOn'
- impl light attenuation, position, direction
- impl HDR skybox again
- fix camera controls UI
- add a single light and camera class to the new CLscene object
- write code to load scene from file using ASSIMP
- import code to register hits on both sides of a tri
- create a 'CLmodel' object with CLBounds3 for its bbox

DONE
====
- change all class names to 'CLxxx' to prevent naming collision
--- change Ray to CLRay
- create 'CLscene' class
